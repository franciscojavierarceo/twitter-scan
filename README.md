# twitter-scan

This is a repository hosting a small project idea from Twitter.

These are the goals of this project:

1. Learn Fast-API
2. Learn Twitter's Oauth2 for Fast-API
3. Deploy an NLP model using word embeddings
4. Have the model auto-update based on feedback (this is a maybe and I'd probably schedule it)
5. Deploy the application on Docker Swarm

Let's see how it goes.
